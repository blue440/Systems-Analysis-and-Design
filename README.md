# Systems-Analysis-and-Design

Briefly summarize the DriverPass project. Who was the client? What type of system did they want you to design?
    This project was a fictional driver education service that wanted to create a website that their students 
    would be able to log in to. Once in the system the students sould be able to view test progress, driver
    notes, and create reservations to learn hands on with a company driver.

What did you do particularly well?
    The UML diagrams that I created were my favorite and that I did pretty well on them.

If you could choose one part of your work on these documents to revise, what would you pick? How would you improve it?
    I think that the Business requirements document could use some revision and additional work. Particularly the
    nonfunctional requirements section.
    
How did you interpret the user’s needs and implement them into your system design? Why is it so important to consider the user’s needs when designing?
    In order to interpret the user's needs during this project I had to familiarize myself with the initial interview
    transcript. The design ideas and requirements were imbeded in the interview. In order to create a product that 
    works well for its users, their needs must be met. Not all of them however, just those that bring value to the
    project.

How do you approach designing software? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to analyze and design a system?
    To design software, I start by looking at what it needs to accomplish. Creating UML diagrams can assist in 
    identifying core aspects of the system. Once those aspects have been determined they can be built and aditional
    functionality can be added later. This course has introduced several concepts and UML diagrams that I will add
    in the future to assist with analysis and design.
